My degree of sucess for this assignment is an 80%. I got all my producer, consumer, and utilities code to for properly. However, when I compile my code, I get a
warning message about my "exit()" function in my program. I am getting some sort of
an implicit declaration warning but I don't think it is nothing serious.

I experimented with my program for a while. I started my program with 1 producer
and 5 consumers with a QUEUE size of 50. When I ran my program for 5 loops a
couple of times, I relatively get 1-2 deadlocks out of 5 loops which means I get
3-4 successful runs. I found out that the probability of getting a deadlock is
pretty low around 30% of the time.

I then brought the QUEUE size down to 45 and my probability of getting deadlock
went to 50%. I believe that this is the 50% mark because when I ran my program
a couple of times again. I get 2-3 dealocks out of 5 loops. At this size, it is
equally likely to get deadlock.

The distribution of this graph over the depth of the QUEUE is almost linear
with a slight curve. I consider using linear regression for an estimate of the
probability.

I then kept my QUEUE size to 45 because I feel that it is my 50% deadlock mark
and experimented with my number of consumers. When I increased the number of
consumers to more than 5, I noticed that my probability of deadlocks went up 
because there are so many consumers that only one producer cannot handle to 
serve donuts to the consumers anymore. That is why some consumers cannot reach 
10 dozen which locks the program.

When I decreased the number of consumers to less than 5, the probability of
deadlocks went down because there are fewer consumers to serve donuts which
makes the producer easier to hand donuts to these consumers. There are not
much consumers to feed.

The distribution I have for this graph is linear because as number of consumers
increase, the probability of deadlocks increase.
